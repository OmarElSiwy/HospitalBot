# How Does the Kalman Filter Work
The Correlation between Known Variables is known as a Covarience Matrix, where the ith state variable and jth state variable are related.
This matrix is symetric

We also have a state vector that consists of all the variables.

let p be postion
let a be linear acceleration
let w be angular velocity

state vector p = last state vector p +
